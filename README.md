## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying

## Theme
Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DoAH&D)

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a Digital Farm Management and Biosecurity Portal designed specifically for Pig and Poultry Farms.
This portal acts as an AI-driven, farmer-centric platform that assists in planning, implementing, and monitoring biosecurity measures through smart risk assessment, training, compliance tracking, and real-time alerts.

The system will integrate data from farmers, veterinarians, and local authorities to enable preventive disease management and evidence-based decision-making.
It will provide an easy-to-use mobile and web interface available in regional languages, ensuring accessibility even for small and marginal farmers.

Key Modules:

1.Biosecurity Risk Assessment Tool

 * Customizable self-assessment forms for pig and poultry farms.

 * AI-based scoring to evaluate the level of compliance and risk factors.

 * Visual dashboard showing improvement areas.

2.Interactive Training & Awareness

 * Gamified modules, videos, and infographics on biosecurity measures.

 * Local language support for easy understanding.

 * Periodic quizzes and digital certification for trained farmers.

3.Compliance & Record Management

 * Digital logs for vaccination, cleaning schedules, and feed management.

 * Auto-generated compliance reports aligned with DoAH&D standards.

4.Real-Time Alerts & Monitoring

 * Geo-tagged outbreak alerts using open data (ICAR, NADRS).

 * Notification of disease-prone zones and safety advisories.

 * Integration with weather and sensor data for early warnings.

5.Collaborative Networking Hub

 * Connect farmers, veterinarians, and government officers.

 * Enable expert consultations and support channels.

 * Allow anonymous disease reporting for rapid response.

## Technical Approach
System Architecture

The solution will follow a modular three-tier architecture:

1.Frontend Layer:

 * React.js / Flutter (for web & mobile apps).

 * Multi-language support (English, Hindi, Tamil, etc.).

 * Simple dashboards, visual alerts, and offline access.

2.Backend Layer:

 * Node.js + Express for REST APIs.

 * Python (FastAPI) for AI-based risk scoring and analytics.

 * Secure authentication using JWT and role-based access.

3.Database & Cloud Layer:

 * MongoDB / PostgreSQL for structured and semi-structured data.

 * Firebase / AWS for notifications and cloud storage.

 * IoT data integration through MQTT (for sensors like temperature, humidity).

4.Data Analytics & AI Module:

 * Machine learning models to predict disease risk zones.

 * Trend visualization for authorities and researchers.

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility

 * Technical: Uses proven, scalable open-source technologies.

 * Operational: Farmers can access through smartphones or kiosks.

 * Financial: Minimal recurring cost via cloud deployment and government support.

 Potential Challenges

 * Low digital literacy among rural farmers.

 * Limited internet connectivity in remote areas.

 * Data privacy and security for farm-level data.

Mitigation Strategies

 * Offline mode in the mobile app with data sync.

 * Audio-visual training content in vernacular languages.

 * End-to-end encryption and government data hosting compliance.

## Impact and Benefits
Social Impact

 * Increased farmer awareness and preparedness for disease prevention.

 * Empowerment of rural communities with self-assessment and learning tools.

Economic Impact

 * Reduced livestock loss due to early detection and preventive care.

 * Increased productivity through continuous monitoring and compliance.

Environmental Impact

 * Promotes sustainable farming with hygienic and eco-friendly practices.

 * Reduces chemical misuse and waste from poor farm hygiene.

Policy-Level Impact

 * Enables government to collect real-time data for biosecurity surveillance.

 * Strengthens national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.
